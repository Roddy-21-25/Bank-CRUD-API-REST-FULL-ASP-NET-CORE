# Bank-CRUD-API-REST-FULL-ASP-NET-CORE

If you want to Test this API, you need to know somethings: 
- Its just a CRUD practice, i did a Crud for two tables of my SQL SERVER. Client and ClientAccount.
- in the proyect there is a charper with the SQL QUERRY, you will need to create a DATABASE with the name : BANK and Use all the querry for create de Tables. They have Swagger so you can test it.
- in the appsettings you will need to change the path of the SQL SERVER
- in the Configurations charper project, there are all the tables configurations, so, create the relations betwen the tables in SQL SERVER using the references of the code.
